## Loading and preprocessing the data

```{r, echo=FALSE}
#steps: Number of steps taking in a 5-minute interval (missing values are coded as NA)
#date: The date on which the measurement was taken in YYYY-MM-DD format
#interval: Identifier for the 5-minute interval in which measurement was taken
```
After loading the data, using the 'summary' function it is posible to see that there are 2304 missing values (NAs) in the data set. To ignore the NAs a new data set without NAs was created.
```{r, echo=TRUE}
datact=read.csv("activity.csv")
str(datact)
summary(datact)
ndatact=datact[!is.na(datact[,1]),]
nasday=tapply(ndatact[,1],ndatact[,2],function(x)sum(is.na(x)))
```


## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?

What is mean total number of steps taken per day?

For this part of the assignment, you can ignore the missing values in the dataset.

Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day

Calculate and report the mean and median total number of steps taken per day

```{r, echo=TRUE}
stepday=tapply(datact[,1],datact[,2],sum,na.rm=TRUE)
hist(stepday,breaks=12)
mean(stepday)
```

## What is the average daily activity pattern?



## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?


This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
